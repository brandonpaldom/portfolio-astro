# Progress Documentation

## What Works
- Basic Astro project structure with component hierarchy
- Tailwind CSS styling implementation
- Navigation system via navbar.json
- Responsive layout foundation
- Project detail page routing ([slug].astro)
- Data loading from JSON files in src/data/

## What's Left to Build
- Contact form validation and submission handling
- Enhanced project detail pages with GitHub API integration
- Skill carousel touch/swipe functionality
- Accessibility improvements across all components
- Performance optimizations for image loading

## Current Status
Initial setup complete with basic portfolio structure:
- Profile section displays correctly
- Project listing is functional
- Resume and skills data is rendered
- Basic styling is in place

## Known Issues
- Contact form lacks validation and submission logic
- Skill carousels are static and not interactive
- Limited mobile-specific optimizations
- Some components lack hover/active states
- Form submission handling needs implementation

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Started with Astro static site generation for performance
- Adopted Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling approach
- Moved to data-driven components for maintainability
- Prioritized responsive design patterns for cross-device support
- Planning to enhance interactivity with client-side JavaScript
